SYNOPSIS
            # in dist.ini
            [@Author::RUSSOZ]

DESCRIPTION
    "Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::RUSSOZ" provides shorthand for a
    Dist::Zilla configuration approximately like:

            [@Basic]

            [MetaJSON]
            [ReadmeFromPod]
            [InstallGuide]
            [GitFmtChanges]
            max_age    = 365
            tag_regexp = ^.*$
            file_name  = Changes
            log_format = short

            [OurPkgVersion]
            [AutoPrereqs]

            [ReportVersions::Tiny]
            [@TestingMania]

            [Twitter]
            tweet_url = http://search.cpan.org/~{{$AUTHOR_LC}}/{{$DIST}}
            hash_tags = #perl #cpan
            url_shortener = TinyURL

USAGE
    Just put "[@Author::RUSSOZ]" in your dist.ini. You can supply the
    following options:

    *   "no_twitter" says that releases of this module shouldn't be tweeted.

    *   "twitter_tags" says which additional hash tags will be used in the
        release tweet. The tags "#cpan" and "#perl" are always added.

SEE ALSO
    "Dist::Zilla"

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    Much of the first implementation was shamelessly copied from
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::DOHERTY.
