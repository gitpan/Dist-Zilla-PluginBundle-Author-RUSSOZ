USAGE
    Just put "[@Author::RUSSOZ]" in your dist.ini. You can supply the
    following options:

    *   version

        How to handle version numbering. Possible values: none, auto (will
        use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion), gitnext (will use
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion). Default = none.

    *   auto_prereqs

        Whether the module will use "AutoPrereqs" or not. Default = 1.

    *   github

        If using github, enable "[GithubMeta]". Default = 1.

    *   use_no404

        Whether to use "[Test::Pod::No404]" in the distribution. Default =
        0.

    *   signature

        Whether to GPG sign the module or not. Default = 1.

    *   task_weaver

        Set to 1 if this is a "Task::" distribution. It will enable
        "[TaskWeaver]" while disabling "[PodWeaver]" and all release tests.
        Default = 0.

    *   fake

        Set to 1 if this is a fake release. It will disable [UploadToCPAN]
        and enable [FakeRelease]. It can also be enabled by setting the
        environemnt variable "FAKE". Default = 0.
