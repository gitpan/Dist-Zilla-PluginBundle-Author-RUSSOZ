	[OurPkgVersion]
	[GithubMeta]                        ; if github = 1
	[AutoPrereqs]                       ; unless auto_prereqs = 0

	[ReportVersions::Tiny]
	[PodWeaver]
	config_plugin = @Author::RUSSOZ

	; if task_weaver =1
	[TaskWeaver]

	; else (task_weaver = 0)
	[@TestingMania]
	disable = Test::CPAN::Changes, SynopsisTests
